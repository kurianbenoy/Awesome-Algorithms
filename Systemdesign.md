3) Load Balancing
- all server are expected to have equal 1/n server
- changing bucket size when no of servers increase
- Now with loadbalancing, same gaurav is mapped to paricular server and cache info change
- Overall change should be less

4) Consistent hashing
- adding or removing servers is problem
- hashing the server ids is also possible
